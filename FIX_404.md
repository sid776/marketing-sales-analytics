# Fix GitHub Pages 404 Error

## The Issue
You're seeing a 404 because GitHub Pages isn't enabled or the workflow hasn't run yet.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Check Workflow Status

1. Go to: https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/actions
2. You should see a workflow run called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click on it to see if it's running/completed
4. If it failed, check the error logs

### Step 3: Manually Trigger Workflow (If Needed)

1. Go to: https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/actions
2. Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button (top right)
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- First deployment takes 3-5 minutes
- Check the Actions tab for progress
- Once complete, your site will be at: https://sid776.github.io/marketing-sales-analytics

## Common Issues

**"Workflow not found"**: 
- Make sure the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file exists
- Check that it was pushed to GitHub

**"Build failed"**:
- Check the Actions log for errors
- Make sure `package.json` has all dependencies
- Verify `next.config.js` is correct

**"Pages not enabled"**:
- Go to Settings → Pages
- Make sure "GitHub Actions" is selected as source
- Not "Deploy from a branch"
