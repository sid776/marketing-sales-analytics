# 🔍 Check GitHub Actions Status

## The workflow should be running now. Please check:

### 1. Go to Actions Tab
**URL:** https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/actions

### 2. What to Look For:
- Do you see a workflow called **"Build and Deploy"**?
- What's its status?
  - ✅ **Green checkmark** = Success (wait 1-2 minutes for Pages to update)
  - 🟡 **Yellow circle** = Running (wait for it to finish)
  - ❌ **Red X** = Failed (click on it to see the error)

### 3. If Workflow is Running/Completed:
- Wait 2-3 minutes after completion
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try incognito/private mode
- Visit: https://sid776.github.io/marketing-sales-analytics

### 4. If Workflow Failed:
- Click on the failed workflow
- Click on "build-and-deploy" job
- Scroll down to see the error message
- **Share the error message with me**

### 5. If No Workflow Appears:
- Check if you're on the correct repository
- Check if the workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- Try manually triggering: Actions tab → "Build and Deploy" → "Run workflow"

## Common Issues:

### Issue: "Workflow not found"
**Fix:** The workflow file might not be in the repository. Check if `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` exists.

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Fix:** Go to Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Select "Read and write permissions"

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Fix:** Check the error in the Actions tab and share it with me.
