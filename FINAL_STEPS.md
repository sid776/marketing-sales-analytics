# ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!

## I've deployed using the gh-pages branch method!

### Now you MUST enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/settings/pages

2. **Under "Source":**
   - Select **"Deploy from a branch"** (NOT GitHub Actions)
   - Branch: **gh-pages**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **Wait 1-2 minutes**

4. **Visit:** https://sid776.github.io/marketing-sales-analytics

## If it still shows 404:

- Wait 2-3 more minutes (GitHub needs time to process)
- Clear your browser cache
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check: https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/settings/pages
  - Should show: "Your site is live at https://sid776.github.io/marketing-sales-analytics"

## Alternative: Use Render (Easier!)

If GitHub Pages keeps giving issues, I can deploy on Render:
- ✅ No manual enabling needed
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Both frontend + backend
- ✅ Free tier available

Just say "use Render" and I'll set it up!
