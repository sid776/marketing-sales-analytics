# ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO THIS NOW

## The 404 means GitHub Pages is NOT enabled. You MUST enable it manually.

### EXACT STEPS (Do this in order):

1. **Open this link in your browser:**
   ```
   https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Scroll down until you see "GitHub Pages" section**

3. **Look for "Source" dropdown** - it probably says "None" right now

4. **Click the dropdown and select "GitHub Actions"**

5. **Click the "Save" button**

6. **Wait 30 seconds, then go to:**
   ```
   https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics/actions
   ```

7. **You should see a workflow running called "Build and Deploy"**

8. **Wait 3-5 minutes for it to complete**

9. **Then visit:**
   ```
   https://sid776.github.io/marketing-sales-analytics
   ```

## If You Don't See the Settings Page:

- Make sure you're logged into GitHub as `sid776`
- Make sure the repository exists: https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics
- Make sure you have admin access to the repository

## If Settings Shows "404" or "Not Found":

The repository might not exist or you don't have access. Check:
- https://github.com/sid776/marketing-sales-analytics

## Alternative: Use Render Instead

If GitHub Pages keeps giving issues, we can deploy on Render which is easier:
- Frontend + Backend both on Render
- No manual enabling needed
- Works immediately

Let me know if you want to switch to Render instead!
